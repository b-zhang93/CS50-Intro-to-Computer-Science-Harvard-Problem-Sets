Similarities:
Created a web application with Python, HTML, CSS, JS through FLASK and JINJA compare two files for similarities. Files are 
uploaded via the website and the output will highlight similar parts of the two files. 

Survey:
Implemented a web app taht enables users to fill out a form (a la google forms) and the results are saved to a CSV file on the server. 
They can then view a table of all the submissions received on the other page. Utilized HTML tables and JINJA to implement the result page.
